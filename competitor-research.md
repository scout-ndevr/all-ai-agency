# ALL AI Agency — Competitor Research

## Competitors Analyzed
1. **Miquido** (miquido.com)
2. **Toptal AI** (toptal.com)
3. **10Clouds** (10clouds.com)
4. **Gigster** (gigster.com)
5. **Turing** (turing.com)
6. **Builder.ai** (builder.ai)

## Visual & Layout Patterns

### Hero Sections
- **Miquido**: Clean, bold headline + subtext + CTA. "Ideate, design, and develop powerful software." Prominent "See our portfolio" link. Available-for-projects badge as trust signal.
- **Gigster**: Enterprise-focused, logo wall of major brands front and center. Multiple engagement models.
- **Turing**: Pivoted to AI training focus. Big bold statements. Stat blocks (4M+ talent, 100+ countries, 97% success rate).
- **10Clouds**: Awards-led approach — Clutch, design awards prominently displayed. Minimal hero text.

### Common Patterns
1. **Social proof above the fold** — client logos, awards badges, Clutch ratings
2. **Stats/numbers blocks** — years in business, projects delivered, team size, success rates
3. **Testimonials with photos** — named quotes from recognizable companies (Dolby, IBM, Abbey Road Studios)
4. **Service cards in grids** — 3-column grids with icons, short descriptions
5. **Dark themes dominate** — most use dark backgrounds for hero, switching to light for content sections
6. **Bold typography** — large headlines (60-80px), tight letter-spacing, heavy font weights
7. **Engagement model sections** — Managed, Dedicated Teams, On-Demand talent options
8. **CTA repetition** — CTAs appear every 2-3 sections, not just hero and footer

### Typography Choices
- **Sans-serif dominates**: Inter, DM Sans, custom brand fonts
- **Headline weights**: 800-900 (Extra Bold to Black)
- **Body text**: 400-500 weight, generous line-height (1.6-1.8)
- **Letter-spacing**: Tight on headlines (-0.02 to -0.04em), normal on body

### Trust Signals That Work
- Clutch/G2/Goodfirms badges
- Named testimonials with company + title
- Client logo walls (6-12 logos)
- Award badges (Webby, Awwwards, etc.)
- Specific stats (not vague — "250+ solutions delivered" not "many projects")

### Color Approaches
- Miquido: Purple/blue accent on dark
- 10Clouds: Blue primary on white
- Gigster: Blue/dark enterprise feel
- Turing: Black/white with minimal color accent

## Key Takeaways for ALL AI Agency

1. **Differentiation opportunity**: None of these agencies lead with the "AI speed + human architect quality" angle. Most are either talent marketplaces or traditional agencies adding AI. ALL AI's positioning is unique.
2. **Need social proof**: Even placeholder client logos or case study teasers would strengthen credibility.
3. **Stats matter**: Add concrete numbers (turnaround time, projects shipped, etc.)
4. **Dark hero → light content is standard** — the current design follows this well.
5. **The "vs" comparison section is strong** — competitors don't do direct comparisons like this.
6. **Consider adding**: Engagement models section, brief case study previews, team/founder credibility signals.

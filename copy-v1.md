## What We Do

### Section Heading
**The output of a senior architect. The velocity of AI.**

### Body Copy
Most teams make you choose: move fast and fix it later, or do it right and wait forever.

We don't accept that tradeoff. Every ALL AI project is directed by a human software architect — someone who's built and scaled real systems. They set the architecture, review every decision, and ensure the code is production-ready before it ships.

AI handles the heavy lifting: scaffolding, iteration, testing, documentation. Your architect handles what AI can't: judgment, tradeoffs, and knowing when "good enough" isn't.

The result: you get senior-level output at a pace that would take a traditional team months.

## Services

### Section Heading
**What we ship**

### Section Description
Full-stack capability, architect-led from kickoff to deployment.

### Cards

**1. MVPs & New Products**
From zero to launched in days. We build functional products that are ready for real users — not throwaway prototypes you'll need to rebuild.

**2. Web Applications**
Full-stack web apps with clean architecture, real performance, and code your team can maintain. Modern frameworks, no shortcuts.

**3. AI-Native Products**
We build products with AI at the core — not bolted on. From LLM integrations to custom agents, we know what works in production and what just demos well.

**4. Mobile & Cross-Platform**
Native-quality apps that run everywhere. We pick the right approach for your product — React Native, Flutter, or fully native — based on what actually matters.

**5. Platform Modernization**
Legacy systems slowing you down? We modernize incrementally. Ship improvements continuously while keeping everything running.

**6. Technical Strategy**
Don't know where to start? Our architects assess your stack, map out the opportunities, and build a plan that's honest about tradeoffs.

## 3E Framework

### Section Heading
**The 3E Framework**

### Section Description
Every product we build is measured against three standards. No exceptions. No "we'll get to it later."

### Cards

**Engineering Excellence**
Clean code isn't optional — it's the baseline. Tested, documented, scalable. Built so your next developer doesn't curse the last one.

**Elegant Experience**
Users don't read architecture docs. They feel the product. We obsess over the interactions, the speed, the moments that make people stay.

**Enduring Evolution**
Products change. We architect for it — extensible systems, clear patterns, and decisions that make your next iteration as fast as the first.

## Why ALL AI

### Section Heading
**We exist because the alternatives aren't good enough.**

### Section Description
Speed or quality. Pick one. That's what everyone else says. We don't.

### Cards

**vs Vibe Coding**
*Fast until it breaks.*
Vibe coding ships quick — until a bad abstraction cascades through your codebase. No architect caught it because there wasn't one. We put an architect in the loop from the start.

**vs Traditional Agencies**
*Quality, eventually.*
Traditional agencies bill hours, not outcomes. Weeks of discovery, months of development, budgets that balloon. We use AI to collapse the timeline without cutting the quality.

**vs AI Tools Alone**
*Code without context.*
AI can generate code. It can't make architectural decisions. It doesn't know your business constraints, your scale requirements, or when the obvious solution is the wrong one. Our architects do.

## Process

### Section Heading
**How it works**

### Section Description
Four steps. No mystery. You'll see working software before most agencies finish their discovery phase.

### Steps

**01 — Scope**
We talk about what you need, what matters, and what doesn't. Your architect defines the approach and sets the boundaries.

**02 — Sprint**
AI-accelerated development with architect review at every checkpoint. You'll see working builds, not slide decks.

**03 — Refine**
Real feedback on real software. We iterate fast — usually same-day — because the architect is in the code, not in a meeting.

**04 — Ship**
Production deployment with monitoring, documentation, and a clean handoff. Your team can maintain it. Or we can.

## Bottom CTA

### Headline
**Ready to ship something real?**

### Subhead
No pitch decks. No 6-week discovery phase. Just a conversation about what you need and how fast we can get there.

### CTA Button
**Let's Talk**

## Notes for Matt
- "Architect-Level Led" works as both tagline and descriptor — it explains the name and the value prop in one phrase
- Copy avoids: "leverage," "synergy," "cutting-edge," "revolutionize" — all banned
- Tone aims for: the confidence of someone who's shipped a lot of software and doesn't need to prove it with buzzwords
- Services are framed around what the client gets, not what tech we use
- The "why" section directly addresses the three alternatives prospects are weighing
